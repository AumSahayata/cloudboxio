## 🧪 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.24+
- SQLite3 (optional CLI for viewing DB)

---

### 🛠️ Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cloudboxio.git
cd cloudboxio
go mod tidy
go run main.go
```
---
## 🌐 Server Info

The server starts at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

The `.env` file is **auto-generated** if missing, and will include:

```env
LOG_TO_CONSOLE=true
LOG_FILE_OPS=true
JWT_SECRET=<auto-generated>
```
---

## 🧾 Logging

Logs are saved to logs/server.log by default.

Optional file operation logs go to logs/fileops.log when `LOG_FILE_OPS=true` (Default true).

Console logging for server logs can be toggled using `LOG_TO_CONSOLE=true` (Default true).
